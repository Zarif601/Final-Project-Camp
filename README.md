# Topic: 
Predicting whether or not a future patient will have a stroke or not - using machine learning models - trained on data (Clean up later)

## Why did we choose this topic: 
(MAKE SOMETHING UP LATER) - raise awareness - prevelency

# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
In this project, we aim to explore and analyze the "stroke_data" dataset. The dataset comprises of common characteristics (such as age, occupation, marital status, etc.) associated to stroke risk. In order to properly analyze the dataset, we use the Python library 'Pandas' to clean and organize our data. The programming language R will be used to conduct any furhter statistical analysis.  

## Database Storage
Using the Python library SQLAlchemy, we will connect our notebooks to PostgreSQL (our method of database storage). To display our data, we will be using github pages.
